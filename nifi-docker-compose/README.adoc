= nifi-docker-compose

_Based on an original idea from link:https://community.cloudera.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/98373[@Arqui] in this link:https://community.cloudera.com/t5/Support-Questions/NiFi-single-user-Certificate-and-Token-not-found/m-p/345007/highlight/true#M234326[community forum post]._

The link:https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/nifi[Apache NiFi Docker image] is a pretty handy way to quickly launch a single-node NiFi cluster.

This docker-compose configuration file uses the NiFi docker image to launch a 2-node NiFi cluster.
The NiFi configuration and repositories are persisted in Docker volumes, so they survive cluster restarts.

The cluster is configured to use the `single-user` provider and authorizer. The default credentials are `admin/supersecret1`. You can change this in the configuration file if needed.

A `nginx` service is also part of the deployment to distribute connections to both NiFi nodes. To connect to the cluster, point your browser to `https://localhost:8443/nifi`.

== Starting the cluster

Execute the following command on this directory:

[source,shell]
----
docker compose up -d
----

== Stopping the cluster

Execute the following command on this directory:

[source,shell]
----
docker compose down
----

== Resetting the cluster content

If you want to clear/discard the content of your NiFi cluster so that you can start a fresh one, execute the following commands on this directory:

[source,shell]
----
docker compose down
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q --filter "name=nifi-docker-compose")
----
